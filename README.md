# Project: Statistical Implementation with RMarkdown
## Overview
This project consists of multiple R Markdown files that demonstrate the implementation of various statistical techniques. Topics covered include Markov Chains, Linear Programming, and Random Number Generation. These examples are part of a Statistical Computing course from my university with a few extra examples I added.

The project aims to showcase the practical applications of statistical methods using R


## Key Topics
The following key topics are explored through RMarkdown examples:
### 1. Markov Chains
Implementation of discrete Markov chains
Understanding transition matrices and steady-state behavior
### 2. Linear Programming
Solving optimization problems using linear programming
Use of the lpSolve package for formulation and solution
Sensitivity analysis and interpretation of results
### 3. Random Number Generation
Exploring methods for generating random variables
Application of random number generators in simulations
Statistical analysis of random sampling techniques

## Libraries and Packages Used
This project makes use of several key R libraries to facilitate statistical computation and visualization:

ggplot2: For creating high-quality, customizable plots and visualizations
lpSolve: For solving linear programming problems
plot3D: For graphing a 3D joint probability distribution
