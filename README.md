Project: Multiple R assignments from university to demonstrate my learning of the language. 

In these files, there are problems solved using the R programming language. I used the ggplot() library for graphing, with lpSolve() for linear programming, and made a lot of use with both vectors and dataframes. 

R is a very interesting language, and I believe there is still a lot I could learn from it.
