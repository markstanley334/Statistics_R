Project: Multiple R markdown files demonstrating statistical implementation of various topics, including Markov chains, linear programming, and random number generation. These examples are from a statistical computing course from my university. 

I used the ggplot() library for graphing, with lpSolve() for linear programming, and made a lot of use with both vectors and dataframes.
